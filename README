Deliverable 2
Target User Group
Adults 65+ in the U.S. who face challenges using smartphones, computers, and online services.

Description of the Problem
Many older adults lack digital literacy, leaving them unable to use essential technologies such as healthcare portals, online banking, food delivery apps, or communication tools like video calls. This gap creates barriers to independence, access to resources, and social connection for the older generation.

Evidence of the Problem
•	A 2022 Pew Research study found that 27% of U.S. adults aged 65+ do not use the internet at all, and over 54% of those aged 75+ struggle with digital literacy.
•	A government survey in South Korea revealed that 80% of adults aged 60+ struggle with digital devices, compared to just 8.9% of younger adults.

Consequences if Left Unaddressed
If this problem is ignored older adults risk increasing isolation, dependency, and unequal access to healthcare, financial services, and social opportunities. This exclusion can lead to depression, negative health outcomes, and a reduction of quality of life.

Ethical Framework
•	Principle: Everyone should have equitable access to technology and essential services.
•	Application: Without support, elders are unfairly excluded from systems designed for the majority, violating fairness and accessibility standards.
•	Stakeholders: Older adults, caregivers, healthcare providers, banks, and communities.
•	Connection to Values: Many healthcare laws and community initiatives emphasize equal access (e.g., ADA standards, digital inclusion initiatives).
•	Ethical Position: Promoting digital equity ensures older adults can remain independent and socially connected, respecting dignity and justice.

"How Might We" Statement
How might we design a simple and supportive way for older adults to receive detailed and quick tech guidance so they can easily use essential digital tools without feeling dependent or excluded?
