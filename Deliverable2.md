User Group: First-Generation College Students

Problem Description: 
First-generation college students often experience a reduced sense of belonging and social on campus due to limited family experience with higher education. These barriers make it difficult to access mentorship, extracurricular opportunities, and professional networks, leading to lower engagement, increased stress, and higher odds of delayed graduation or dropping out. 

Evidence of the Problem:
According to firstgenfoward.org, “First-generation students graduate at a rate of 24% versus 59% for continuing-generation students.”

“First generation college students (I.e., those who are the first in their family to attend college) make up nearly 1 in 4 clients presenting to college counseling centers in the United States” - Wilson Trusty, PennState Student Affairs Center for Collegiate Mental Health
