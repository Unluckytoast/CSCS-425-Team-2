Deliverable 3 – AI-Assisted Market Research Report

---

## Introduction

Shared living arrangements among college students and young professionals have become increasingly common in recent years. Rising rental costs, delayed homeownership, and economic pressures have pushed millions of young adults to live with roommates well into their 20s and 30s. While cost-sharing provides financial relief, it also introduces recurring conflicts over chores, bills, and lifestyle differences. This report investigates the roommate living market, identifies the primary pain points faced by users, and evaluates existing competitor apps. Finally, it outlines the unique value proposition (UVP) of a new solution designed to address these challenges more comprehensively.

## User Group Profile

The primary user group for this solution includes college students and young professionals between the ages of 18 and 30 who share apartments or houses with roommates. According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB, 2025), **6.8 million U.S. households are shared by unrelated roommates or housemates**, marking an all-time high. Within the 18–24 age group, over one in five leaseholders live with roommates, further underscoring the size and relevance of this market.

This demographic tends to be highly tech-savvy, with strong familiarity using budgeting apps (e.g., Venmo, Mint) and productivity tools (e.g., Google Calendar, Trello). However, their pain points remain persistent. A 2023 Apartment List survey found that **41% of renters experience tension due to uneven chore distribution**. Similarly, a 2022 Rent.com study reported that **30% of roommate conflicts stem from splitting bills or rent payments**. Noise complaints and lifestyle clashes represent another recurring issue, impacting approximately 25% of shared households (NCBI, 2021).

Collectively, these statistics reveal a consistent pattern: the absence of structured systems for fairness and accountability creates recurring stress in roommate relationships.

## Market Size & Opportunity

The roommate market represents millions of potential users across the United States. With **6.8 million shared households**, even a conservative adoption rate of **5%** translates into approximately **340,000 households**, or around **1 million active users**, given an average of three roommates per household.

Beyond sheer size, the market shows clear demand for tools that integrate multiple aspects of roommate life. Current apps tend to silo their functions: some focus exclusively on bills, while others concentrate on chores. Few provide a holistic system that supports fairness, transparency, and communication. Given the rise of co-living arrangements in both urban and suburban areas, there is significant opportunity for an all-in-one solution that addresses both financial and interpersonal aspects of roommate living.

## Competitor Analysis

Several apps already target shared living arrangements, though each tends to focus narrowly on one problem area.

**Splitwise** is perhaps the most well-known roommate app, offering expense tracking, IOU management, and payment integration. While it has widespread adoption and an intuitive user interface, it focuses exclusively on financial management. Chore distribution and household task management fall outside its scope.

**Flatastic** attempts a broader approach by combining bill tracking with chore charts and grocery lists. It provides a useful set of tools but has faced criticism for a cluttered interface and relatively lower adoption in the U.S. compared to European markets.

**Sweepy** focuses solely on cleaning management, offering customizable task assignments and gamification features like streaks and progress tracking. However, it does not integrate financial features, leaving users to rely on separate platforms for bill management.

Finally, **Settle Up** competes with Splitwise in expense tracking and group payments but does not address household chores or roommate communication.

A comparison of these apps highlights a significant market gap. While each tackles a portion of the roommate experience, no leading platform combines **financial fairness, chore distribution, and structured communication** into one unified system.

## Vizulation

The visualization below illustrates the distribution of major roommate conflicts. Uneven chores represent the largest source of disputes, followed closely by bill management and noise complaints. These findings validate the need for a comprehensive tool that addresses multiple pain points rather than focusing on a single issue.

## Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

The proposed solution stands out by positioning itself as **the first roommate management platform designed to reduce conflict through fairness and transparency in both chores and finances**. Unlike Splitwise, which focuses solely on expenses, or Sweepy, which focuses solely on chores, this platform integrates:

1. **Shared financial management** – bills, rent, and expenses in one place.
2. **Chore distribution with fairness algorithms** – rotating tasks and tracking contributions to ensure balance.
3. **Conflict prevention tools** – reminders, shared agreements, and structured communication features that reduce awkward confrontations.

This integrated approach directly addresses the most common sources of roommate conflict, while also aligning with professional ethical standards such as the **ACM Code of Ethics 1.2: “Avoid harm.”** By promoting fairness and transparency, the app helps users avoid interpersonal stress that can spill over into academics, work, and well-being.

## AI Use in Research

This report leveraged Generative AI tools, specifically **OpenAI’s GPT-5 with web browsing capabilities**, in combination with traditional research methods. Prompts included: *“Conduct secondary market research on apps for roommates (Splitwise, Flatastic, Sweepy). Compare features and gaps,”* and *“What percentage of renters report roommate conflicts over chores or bills?”*

AI-generated insights were fact-checked against reliable secondary sources, including the **U.S. Census Bureau, NAHB (2025), Apartment List (2023), Rent.com (2022), and official app store listings**. Data visualizations were created in Python using **matplotlib**. This hybrid approach enabled efficient synthesis of data while maintaining accuracy through verification.

## Conclusion

The growing roommate population presents a significant market opportunity for an integrated app that manages both household finances and chores while reducing conflict. Existing competitors only address individual aspects of roommate life, leaving a gap for a solution that promotes fairness, transparency, and harmony. By directly targeting the most common sources of roommate disputes—chores, bills, and communication—this platform has the potential to become the go-to tool for millions of young adults navigating shared living arrangements.
