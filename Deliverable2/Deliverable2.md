## Target User Group
**College Students and Young Professionals Living with Roommates**  
- Typically 18–30 years old  
- Sharing apartments or houses to save on rent and expenses

## Problem Description
Roommates frequently experience conflict over chores, bills, and noise. Without a consistent system for communication and fairness, small disagreements can escalate into:  
- Ongoing tension  
- Unhealthy living environments  
- Broken lease agreements  

### Evidence of the Problem
- *“I feel like I’m always the one cleaning the kitchen, but bringing it up just causes arguments.”* — Anonymous student interview  
- **2023 Apartment List Survey:** 41% of renters reported tension with roommates due to uneven chore distribution.  
- **2022 Rent.com Study:** 30% of roommate conflicts stem from splitting bills or rent, leading to financial stress and mistrust.
