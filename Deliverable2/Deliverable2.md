CSC425 Deliverable 2: User Research & Problem Definition Submission 
Student Name: Zach Walters
Branch Name: ZachWalters - Deliverable 2 User Research
Date Submitted: August 28, 2025

Target User Group
- College Students and Young Professionals Living with Roommates (typically 18–30 years old, sharing apartments or houses to save on rent and expenses).

Problem Description
- Roommates frequently experience conflict over chores, bills, and noise. Without a consistent system for communication and fairness, small disagreements can escalate into ongoing tension, unhealthy living environments, or even broken lease agreements.

-Evidence of the Problem-
- “I feel like I’m always the one cleaning the kitchen, but bringing it up just causes arguments.” — anonymous student interview
- According to a 2023 Apartment List survey, 41% of renters reported tension with roommates due to uneven chore distribution.
- A 2022 Rent.com study found that 30% of roommate conflicts stem from splitting bills or rent, leading to financial stress and mistrust.

“How Might We” Statement
- How might we create a fair and consistent system that helps roommates manage bills, chores, and conflicts to reduce stress and build more harmonious living environments?
