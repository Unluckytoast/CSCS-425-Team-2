App: Roommate budgeting & chore scheduling app
Branch example: D3-JacksonBradley
Roommate households are a growing segment: 6.8 million U.S. households reported sharing housing with unrelated housemates in 2023, creating clear demand for tools that reduce friction around money and chores. The most attractive early market is young-adult roommate households (≈41% of those 6.8M); a focused product with an honest freemium model and integrated chore + split features can capture meaningful revenue in the low-millions within a few years.
 User Group Profile 
Demographics
•	Young adults (≈18–35) are the core group — college students and early-career renters — but growth is occurring among older adults (NAHB notes rising share among 55+). 
•	Urban & high-rent areas disproportionately adopt shared housing (rent pressure drives roommate arrangements). (Census / housing reports). 
•	Phone-first and digitally connected: ~9 in 10 U.S. adults own a smartphone, so a mobile-first app is appropriate. 
Pain points
•	Cleaning / chores is the top roommate pet peeve (surveys show cleaning habits top complaints ~37%). 
•	Money & late/unequal payments — recurring source of friction (surveys find >1 in 5 roommates have argued about finances). 
•	Poor coordination & communication — people want clarity on chores, schedules, and guest/cleaning expectations. (Multiple renter/roommate surveys). 
Daily habits relevant to product design
•	Mobile-first workflows (users rely on phone reminders, calendar apps, messaging). 
•	Frequent small shared purchases (groceries, supplies) and recurring bills (rent, utilities) that need tracking. 
•	Irregular schedules across roommates — flexibility and recurring/rotating chore assignment features are valuable. 

2) Market Size & Opportunity 

Recent housing data shows 6.8 million U.S. households share living space with unrelated roommates (2023). That gives a concrete U.S. household TAM for a roommates’ coordination app. If we focus on the young-adult segment (≈41% of those roommates per NAHB), the serviceable available market (SAM) is roughly 2.79 million U.S. young-adult roommate households. With a conservative ARPU assumption of $24/year (freemium + paid Pro features), TAM → ~$163M/year (6.8M × $24), SAM → ~$66.9M/year (2.788M × $24). An attainable early SOM (1–5% of SAM in first 3 years) is ~27.9k–139.4k households, or ~$0.67M–$3.35M/year in run-rate revenue under the same ARPU assumption. (Notes: ARPU is an assumption; industry bill-splitting market research reports and fintech trends validate growing demand for these app categories). 
Metric	Estimate (households)	Estimated annual revenue (USD)
TAM (U.S. roommate households)	6,800,000	$163,200,000 (6.8M × $24 ARPU) 
SAM (young-adult roommate households ≈41%)	2,788,000	$66,912,000 (2.788M × $24) 
SOM (1%–5% of SAM; 3-year target)	27,880 – 139,400	$669,120 – $3,345,600

Splitwise	

Expense splitting, groups, custom splits, recurring bills, Pro subscription, Pay integrations. 
	Very widely used for bill splitting; simple UX; handles complex split math; strong brand recognition.	Limited chore/task coordination; growing user complaints about shifting paywall / premium gating; many users want integrated chore features	High adoption; mixed reviews where power-users point to Pro limits and paywalls.
Tricount	Simple group expense tracking, trip and household modes, web + mobile.	Free/unlimited positioning; strong in Europe; very easy on-boarding for trips and household splits.	Not designed for chores/scheduling; fewer social/accountability features; 	Positive ratings for ease of use; used heavily for trips & shared expenses.
OurHome	Chore charts, task scheduling, shared grocery lists, points/gamification.	Strong at chore management, gamified incentives (works well for families / motivated groups)	Expense-splitting and nuanced fairness for bills are weak; gamification may not suit adult roommates in all households.	Praised for chores and organization; some users say it’s family-oriented rather than adult roommate-oriented.

Gaps our app can fill
•	Integrated finance + chores in one product (many apps do one or the other well).
•	Fairness algorithms that consider room size, usage, and cleaning load (not just even splits).
•	Transparent pricing / generous free tier and built-in enforcement/accountability (reminders, simple settlement flows).

RoomEase helps roommates stop arguing and start coordinating — one app for fair bill splitting, shared shopping, and chore scheduling. We combine smart fairness (room-size/use weighting), easy settlement, and flexible chore rotations so households save time and reduce conflict without juggling multiple tools.
